abstract = "This chapter contributes to understanding the role of the Chilean middle class in what has been called the “estallido social” [social outburst] and the aftermath that followed that process, which included strong episodes of violence in urban areas of the country. For that purpose, we analyze data collected immediately after that outbreak by the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC), using the 2019 wave. Our findings show the diversity of responses from the middle classes to that fundamental political event. While most were in favor of the social and institutional changes demanded, there are also traces of solid resistance to the ideas that emerged from the citizens protesting mainly in the streets of central cities, particularly Santiago. We argue that political imaginaries associated with the ideological spectrum, from leftwing to rightwing, were essential to individuals’ position-taking. In doing so, we differentiate our research from accounts more focused on socio-economic differences between the middle ranks. In addition, other important factors such as subjective social status, age, and gender must be included to provide a more thorough explanation."
